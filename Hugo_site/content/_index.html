<h1>Sarah Holdgrafer, Technical Communicator</h1>

Technical Communication, MA | Content Strategist | UX Writer |


I take a holistic approach to creating quality user experiences. From research to operations, I work diligently towards simplicity in content and scalability in process. In my most recent role as the Director of Content & Research at Auctane, I drove our in-product content strategy, defined content guidelines and standards, and managed content operations for multiple brands. My goal was to ensure every one of our users received the right content, at the right time, in the right place, and for the right task. 


The digital products we use to run our world should be as usable and friction-less as possible. Simply, I want to build good products people actually want to use. It’s not easy, but it’s worth the trouble.
